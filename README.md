# Concepts

## Tree
Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.

## Tree Vocabulary 
The topmost node is called root of the tree. The elements that are directly under an element are called its children. The element directly above something is called its paren.
```
      tree
      ----
       j    <-- root
     /   \
    f      k  
  /   \      \
 a     h      z    <-- leaves
```
